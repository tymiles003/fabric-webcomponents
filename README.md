# Fabric UI Web Components
This is an *unofficial* implementation of the React-based [Fabric UI](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric#/controls/web) as Web Components. This project aims to make Fabric UI more accessible to a broader range of developers by implementing the Fabric UI controls in a framework-independent way. This project is work-in-progress and has some known shortcomings (no minimized files, spare documentation, controls are not well tested and do not claim feature-parity). As the project matures these issues will (hopefully) get less.

## Currently supported controls
- Toggle (*fluid-toggle*)
- Textbox (*fluid-textbox*)
- Spinbutton (*fluid-spinbutton*)

## How to use these components
Just copy + paste all source code of the components you want to use in your application.

## Documentation
In the making, follows soon. Until then please check out the inline comments for every component to learn about available attributes and their behavior.
